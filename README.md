# Example InSpec Profile

This was an exercise to practice building a profile of InSpec controls for CentOS 6 CIS benchmarks based on [Nathen Harvey's InSpec Workshop](https://github.com/chef-training/workshops/tree/master/InSpec). I then remediated with a [practice cookbook](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/inspec-workshop-cookbook).
